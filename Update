OXUL103 Jailbreak
+Updates
+Beta iPAs
-----------------------------------------------------------------
**UPDATES:**
- "App" file created. (all consistent files, and imagery of the current look of the icons, expect some glitches).
- "Resources" embeded to require the notification to respring and edit the running system.
(FEWER OR SEVERAL BOOTS MAY OR WILL HAPPEN). . . The iDevice will read as the OS system isn't running as usual, and will reboot.
Constant rebooting may have been caused by an error during the exploitation.
- "phoneOS" now has to be recognised and diagnosed to fully get the Jailbroken files system (exploit) embeded into the device.
- "Cydia.app" has been updated, new tweaks added for stability. Fixes ;connect to iTunes Restoration mode;.
_ "Jailbreak running stability checked and fluently updated"/ Running file systems, only 64-bit devices capabilities.

**Beta iPA**
Beta 1: Finished and completed, needs to be refurbished, plus i'm in the need of more developers to test new beta's and testing stabilities.
[fustrates me to buy idevices, spending a lot of money to test an exploit that may or may not work on a typical device!]
All new developers get shoutouts in every update and commit.
Beta 2: Almost completed, threw fewer devices into panic boot. Adding more sourcery to endure better quality and to qualify to stay open for
multiple usage timing, and to stay active and not cause freezing, nor crashes.
Beta 3: Yet to be developed.
Beta 4: Yet to be developed.
Beta 5: Yet to be developed.
