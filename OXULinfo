Official Commit - OXUL103 JAILBREAK
Faulting:
-If, (under any circumstances) your iDevice breakes, or
is in unusable conditions, YOU'RE the one to blame
not me!, it's your own iDevice going at risk if you down-
load this jailbreaking tool. 
- If your iDevice is currently usable with active warranty
DO NOT Jailbreak your iDevice! Your warranty will
not be valid, and Apple will not fix your device if it's
Jailbroken.
- If you use this tool in any inappropriate manner, you
will be the cause of any failure in your file system, 
containing the flow control of the root/filesystem.
(Pretty much saying if you backdoor this tool, you will
be named for fraud and scamming.) I (iBootBeta2)
do not consent anyone to allow the edit of any based
file system to do with the way the jailbreak program
operates.
- If you agree to allowing your iDevice OS version to be
modified in this way (in this case; Jailbreak) you may
continue.
                  [However, if you disagree to have your device
Jailbroken, please disregared this and exit all Jailbreak
programs that you want nothing to do with your device.]
-----------------------------------------------------
Disobeying these IMPORTANT rules may classify
your iDevice to endure kernel panic's and internal 
operating in general issues.
If you use this tool to in any way attempt to scam
or fraud someone, you will be reported and removed.

WHAT IS JAILBREAK?
---------------------------------
- Jailbreak is an exploitation which modifies the
running iOS version to allow different perimeters that
the Jailbreak user wishes to use and own.
                      Instantly after the boot of the exploit, cydia
will be installed and your device will be now 100% completed
jailbreak.
-------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IS CYDIA?
-------------------------
- Cydia is like appstore, except Cydia is way better.
You are capable of having free iAP-Purchases-
(inapp-purchases) at no cost.
        There are many ways that Cydia can benefit you and
your device, these are called tweaks, which allow other
modifications that you would like to have on your device.
You can add repositories which allow you to add
sources which tweaks belong with that package so you're
capable to install the desired tweak or application by
using the search bar.
